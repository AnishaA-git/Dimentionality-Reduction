# Dimentionality-Reduction

## Execution Time for each Technique, for both Tabular and Image dataset

1. We can see that image dataset takes more time for the above techniques as compared with tabular dataset.
2. Also, among the techniques, PCA is the most efficient technique for dimentionality reduction as it takes least amount of time in both datasets.
3. UMAP takes the longest time for the reduction of dimentionality.
